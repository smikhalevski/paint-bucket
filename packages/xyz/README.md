XYZ color model plugin for [Paint Bucket](https://github.com/smikhalevski/paint-bucket/).

XYZ is an additive color model based on how the eye interprets stimulus from light. Unlike other additive RGB like color
model, XYZ is a purely mathematical model. The primary components are "imaginary," meaning you can't create the
represented color in the physical by shining any lights representing X, Y, and Z.
